Keep IoT button type devices alive via a relay and pi

# About
When testing IoT devices, we can come across devices that require a button to be pressed to activate the device. 
This can hinder scans if the device goes into a deep sleep state. This script was created to mimic a button being pressed every x seconds via a relay and raspberry pi.
